The three zip files contians original files downloded from (from http://betov.free.fr/).

code for the software is embedded in the exe so you need to open the RosAsmxxxxb 
file in the RosAsmfull program

Here is the original readme file I found inside the zipfile.


    * Create a Directory and unzip inside: RosAsmFiles.zip. (RosAsm
      itself, can be anywhere on your disk)
    
    * Run RosAsm. Run [Configuration] [Companion Files] to provide
      the Path to this Directory. RosAsm can not do anything before
      knowing where 'Equates.equ' is. Do the same with [Help Files] 
      if you wish to have them available in the Menu, and for B_U_Asm
      for having the integrated Help system.

    * In [Configuration]/[Sources Editor], choose a Font that renders
      properly (some of them may not work well -because the OS is poorely
      designed for 16/8 Fixed Pitch Fonts-). If the required 16/8 Fonts
      appear to small, review your Parameters in the OS [Configuration
      Panel]/[Screen]/[Parameters]/[Advanced]/[Fonts Sizes]. If nothing
      finally works, reload the OS default Fonts from your OS CD (they
      may have been modified by SoftWares...).
