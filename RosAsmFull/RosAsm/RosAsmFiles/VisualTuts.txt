            RosAsm  'Interactive Visual Tutorials'  Introduction for Beginners
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have never been involved in programming before but you are familiar with operating a PC and have used a word processor and have used a text editor like 'Notepad' and thought it was limited in its scope you are right. But thats all thats needed to write program code.

RosAsm's source editor is nothing at all like Notepad and while deceiving in its simple IDE design is where you need to begin. 
            
               Just run 'RosAsm'. 

Its menu bar has a 'Help' menu item , click it and on it you will find 'Visual Tuts', clicking it brings up a Pop Up Menu and select the 'debug.exe' item.

'RosAsm' will then load the program's source code which is actually a part of the executable '.exe'  file itself. 

When the program's source code is loaded select  'Run'  from RosAsm's menu bar and then watch 'RosAsm' run the actual program's machine language code. 

Begin by clicking its Help > Contents menu and read the short blurb on how to use the 'Interactive Visual Tutorials'. Then close the help dialog and   read on, when you are given a task to do simply close the program to return to RosAsm's source editor - and -  you're off to your programming future ..... 

       Have fun and enjoy......
