These files must be executed within the RosAsm IDE,
because they are to be used with the integrated debugger.

Therefore, they cannot run stand-alone.

For learning assembly language (Assembly), you need first,
an Assembler.

There are many free Assemblers. The most appropriate assembler
for you depends on what kind of programmation you plan to do.

Unfortunately, each Assemblers has its own unique syntax.
So the syntax of Assembler-A is not 100% compatible with
Assembler-B. Here, we have chosen a form of "generic syntax"
of assembly language. This is so that you could, in future,
switch to any other assembler, with as few overhead as possible.

To help you understand these tutorials, you will have the benefit
of viewing what is going on through RosAsm's integrated debugger.

Other reasons for choosing RosAsm are:

* RosAsm is the easiest integrated development environment (IDE).
  You will not need to care about including external files or
  prototyping of the operating system's API and equates, and so on. 

* RosAsm is the only assembler that comes with an IDE with native
  integration of a source level debugger, source editor that can
  handle huge sources, disassembler and resource designer, etc.

* RosAsm allows a flexible use of syntax which enables these
  lessons to be presented in a generic syntax format.

This last reason is applied in the first tutorial which you will
start with.


Have fun.

PS. The "*.clo" Files that you will see inside the Asm Lessons,
are Command Line Options, used as explained at the bottom of the
first Lesson.
